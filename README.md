## Introduction to Unity
## Group 33, hgauditz, lmenzner, lokonnek

This repository contains the files for running 'PonyWorld', a unity project.
The course preceding this final assignment was held by Nora Maleki, Maximilian Wächter & Farbod Nosrat Nezami at the University of Osnabrück in the winter term 2020/21.

## Gameplay

In this jumping game the goal is to let a pony collect as many carrots as possible whilst jumping over hurdles.
The pony is placed upon a ground layer and can make a single jump by pressing “Space” and move to the left and right by pressing the “A” and “D” keys respectively. 
Every time the pony touches an obstacle, a life is subtracted. When all lives are lost or the pony falls off the track the game is over.
Look out for Power-ups that might change up the course of your game.

## Running the game 

In order to run the game, download the files as a .zip folder and start it in Unity Hub. In the folder scenes you will find the game under 'Main'. 
Please double-check the format setting and change it to 16:9 if necessary
to enjoy the best possible gameplay. Be sure to maximize on play to get the best view of your pony.

Have fun navigating your pony through the clouds and collect as many carrots as you can!
